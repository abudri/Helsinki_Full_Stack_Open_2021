Each directory above, 1a, 1b, 1c, and 1d contain the lesson notes in their respective `README.md`s.

## JavaScript materials Recommened in Part 1b

There exist both good and poor guides for JavaScript on the Internet. Most of the links on this page relating to JavaScript feature reference [Mozilla's JavaScript Guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript).

It is highly recommended to immediately read [A re-introduction to JavaScript (JS tutorial)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript) on Mozilla's website.

If you wish to get to know JavaScript deeply there is a great free book series on the Internet called [You-Dont-Know-JS](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS).

Another great resource for learning JavaScript is [javascript.info](https://javascript.info/).

[egghead.io](https://egghead.io/) has plenty of quality screencasts on JavaScript, React, and other interesting topics. Unfortunately, some of the material is behind a paywall.
